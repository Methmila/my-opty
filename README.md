## Cross-Module Integration Points

| From Module | To Module | Integration Pattern |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Order | Catalog | Read frame/lens stock, decrement on order |
| Order | Billing | Create payment record on order confirmation |
| Order | Workflow | Auto-create task in order-processing queue |
| Workflow | Catalog | Read low-stock for auto-generate dealer emails |
| Workflow | Order | Read pending orders for queue, summarize for reports |
| Billing | Order | Read order total for payment amount |
| All | Shared | Auth, user lookup, current user context |

**Integration Rules:**
- Modules communicate via **service interfaces** (not direct repository access)
- Shared kernel: only `shared` module entities (AppUser, enums)
- Events for async: `OrderPlacedEvent`, `StockChangedEvent`, `PaymentCompletedEvent`
- No circular dependencies between feature modules

---

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming
```
<type>/<module>-<short-description>
```
Examples:
- `feat/catalog-add-frame-crud`
- `fix/order-prescription-validation`
- `docs/workflow-api-spec`

### Commit Messages (Conventional Commits)
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]
```
Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`

### Module Ownership
- Each student owns their package end-to-end (controller → service → repository → migration)
- Shared code in `com.myopty.shared` requires team consensus
- Cross-module references: use **service interfaces** or **events**, not direct entity access

### Database Migrations
- Each module owns its tables → creates its own Flyway migration files
- Naming: `V<version>__<module>_<description>.sql`
- Example: `V2__catalog_create_frame_table.sql`

---

## API Design Guidelines

- RESTful, plural nouns: `/api/frames`, `/api/orders/progressive`
- Version in URL if breaking: `/api/v1/...`
- Standard responses:
  ```json
  { "success": true, "data": {...}, "meta": {...} }
  { "success": false, "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }
  ```
- Pagination: `?page=0&size=20&sort=createdAt,desc`
- Filtering: `?category=men&minPrice=1000&maxPrice=5000`

---
