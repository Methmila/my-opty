## System Architecture Context

This is a **modular monolith** with 4 feature modules owned by individual team members:

| Module | Package | Owner | Student ID |
|--------|---------|-------|------------|
| **Catalog & Inventory** | `com.myopty.catalog` | Amarasekara K.N. | IT25103193 |
| **Order & Prescription** | `com.myopty.order` | Welikuburawatta M.D.L | IT25300262 |
| **Workflow & Communication** | `com.myopty.workflow` | Karunarathna KHMMM | IT25101670 |
| **Payment & Billing** | `com.myopty.billing` | Kankanamge P M G | IT24300359 |
| **Shared Infrastructure** | `com.myopty.shared` | Team-wide | — |

## Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

### Scope Convention

Use the **module name** as scope for feature/fix commits:

```
feat(catalog): add frame CRUD endpoints
fix(order): prescription validation for progressive lenses
docs(workflow): update API spec for dealer emails
refactor(billing): simplify invoice generation
test(shared): add auth integration tests
chore(catalog): add flyway migration for stock_entry
```

### Examples

```
feat(catalog): add frame CRUD endpoints

Implements POST/GET/PUT/DELETE for /api/frames with validation.
Includes category filtering and pagination.

Closes #12
```

```
fix(order): prescription validation for progressive lenses

Adds server-side validation for add_power field when is_progressive=true.
Returns 400 with field errors if missing.

Fixes #45
```

```
docs: update README with module responsibilities
```

### Review Process

1. All PRs require at least **one approval** before merging
2. **Module owner must approve** changes to their module
3. Ensure all CI checks pass
4. Address all review comments
5. Squash commits if requested by maintainers

---

## Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:

```
<type>/<module>-<short-description>
```

### Module Prefixes

| Module | Prefix |
|--------|--------|
| Catalog & Inventory | `catalog` |
| Order & Prescription | `order` |
| Workflow & Communication | `workflow` |
| Payment & Billing | `billing` |
| Shared Infrastructure | `shared` |

### Examples

- `feat/catalog-add-frame-crud`
- `fix/order-prescription-validation`
- `docs/workflow-api-spec`
- `refactor/billing-invoice-generation`
- `test/shared-auth-integration`
- `chore/catalog-flyway-stock-entry`

---

## Module Ownership Rules

### Owner Responsibilities
- Each student **fully owns** their module package end-to-end:
  - Controllers, Services, Repositories
  - Domain entities & DTOs
  - Flyway migrations for their tables
  - Unit & integration tests
  - API documentation (OpenAPI annotations)

### Cross-Module Changes
- **Never** directly import another module's entities/repositories
- Use **service interfaces** defined in `shared` or **events** for communication
- If you need data from another module, request an API endpoint or event
- Changes spanning modules require **both owners' approval**

### Shared Module (`com.myopty.shared`)
- Changes require **team consensus** (all 4 members)
- Includes: auth, user entities, global exceptions, common DTOs, config
- PRs to `shared` need 2+ approvals

---

## Database Migrations

### Rules
- Each module owns its tables → creates its own Flyway migration files
- **Never** modify another module's tables in your migration
- **Never** modify a migration after it's been applied (create a new one instead)

### Naming Convention
```
V<version>__<module>_<description>.sql
```

### Examples
```
V2__catalog_create_frame_table.sql
V3__order_create_prescription_table.sql
V4__workflow_create_todo_task_table.sql
V5__billing_create_payment_table.sql
V6__shared_create_app_user_table.sql
V7__catalog_add_frame_image_url.sql
```

### Migration Version Coordination
- Use sequential versions across modules (check latest V number before creating)
- Announce new migrations in team chat before applying

---

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code style in each module
- Run linters/formatters before committing (`./mvnw spotless:apply` if configured)
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- **Package-private** by default for internal classes; `public` only for API surfaces

### Layer Structure (per module)
```
com.myopty.<module>/
├── controller/     # REST endpoints, request/response DTOs
├── service/        # Business logic, interfaces + implementations
├── repository/     # Spring Data JDBC repositories
├── domain/         # Entities, enums, value objects
├── dto/            # Data transfer objects (request/response)
├── mapper/         # Entity ↔ DTO mapping
├── exception/      # Module-specific exceptions
└── event/          # Domain events (published to other modules)
```

---

## API Design Standards

- RESTful, plural nouns: `/api/frames`, `/api/orders/progressive`
- Version in URL if breaking: `/api/v1/...`
- Standard response envelope:
  ```json
  { "success": true, "data": {...}, "meta": {...} }
  { "success": false, "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }
  ```
- Pagination: `?page=0&size=20&sort=createdAt,desc`
- Filtering: `?category=men&minPrice=1000&maxPrice=5000`
- All endpoints documented with OpenAPI annotations (`@Operation`, `@Parameter`, `@ApiResponse`)

---

## Testing Requirements

### Minimum Coverage
- **Unit tests**: All service logic (≥80% coverage target)
- **Integration tests**: All controller endpoints
- **Repository tests**: Custom queries

### Commands
```bash
# All tests
./mvnw test

# Module-specific
./mvnw test -Dtest=*Catalog*
./mvnw test -Dtest=*Order*
./mvnw test -Dtest=*Workflow*
./mvnw test -Dtest=*Billing*
./mvnw test -Dtest=*Shared*

# With coverage report
./mvnw test jacoco:report
```
